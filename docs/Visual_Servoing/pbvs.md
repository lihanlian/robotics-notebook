## ▪ Core idea
{: #core-idea }

PBVS closes the loop on 3D pose error:

1. Estimate camera/target relative pose from image measurements.
2. Compute pose error in SE(3).
3. Apply a control law to reduce translational and rotational error.

## ▪ Typical advantages
{: #typical-advantages }

- Intuitive geometric interpretation
- Smooth Cartesian trajectories
- Easy integration with model-based controllers

## ▪ Typical challenges
{: #typical-challenges }

- Sensitive to pose-estimation errors
- Requires camera calibration accuracy
- Can degrade with poor visual features
