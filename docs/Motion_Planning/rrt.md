Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) are sampling-based motion planning methods that incrementally grow a tree in configuration space.

## Core idea

RRT expands from a start state by repeatedly:

1. Sampling a random state.
2. Finding the nearest node already in the tree.
3. Extending toward the sample with a bounded step.
4. Accepting the new node if it is collision-free.

## Why use RRT

- Works well in high-dimensional spaces.
- Handles complex obstacle geometries.
- Produces feasible paths quickly.

## Common variants

- RRT-Connect
- RRT*
- Informed RRT*
