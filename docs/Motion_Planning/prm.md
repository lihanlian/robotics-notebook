Probabilistic Roadmap Methods (PRM) build a reusable graph of collision-free configurations, then search the graph for a feasible path.

## Core idea

1. Sample many collision-free configurations.
2. Connect nearby samples with local planners.
3. Build a roadmap graph offline.
4. For each query, connect start/goal and run graph search.

## Why use PRM

- Good for multi-query planning problems
- Scales well in high-dimensional configuration spaces
- Reuses the same roadmap across tasks

## Common variants

- Basic PRM
- Lazy PRM
- PRM*
