## Overview

The pinhole camera model describes perspective projection from a 3D point to a 2D image. Let a point expressed in the camera frame be $$P_c=[X,Y,Z]^T$$, with the camera center at the origin and the optical axis aligned with the positive $$Z$$-axis. Although a physical sensor lies behind the pinhole and forms an inverted image, an equivalent virtual image plane at $$Z=f$$ is usually placed in front of it to simplify the geometry.

By similar triangles, the ray from $$P_c$$ through the camera center intersects the virtual image plane at

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
X \\
Y \\
Z
\end{bmatrix}
\longmapsto
\begin{bmatrix}
fX/Z \\
fY/Z \\
f
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

Dropping the fixed third coordinate gives the image-plane location $$(fX/Z,fY/Z)$$. Dividing it by $$f$$ gives the normalized image coordinates used later in this chapter:

$$
x=\frac{X}{Z},
\qquad
y=\frac{Y}{Z}.
$$

In this geometry:

- the **camera center** $$C$$ is the center of projection;

- the **image plane** is the plane at $$Z=f$$;

- the **principal axis** is perpendicular to the image plane and passes through $$C$$;

- the **principal point** $$p$$ is where the principal axis intersects the image plane, with pixel coordinates $$(c_x,c_y)$$;

- the **principal plane** passes through $$C$$ and is parallel to the image plane.

If the same point is initially expressed in the world frame as $$P_w=[X_w,Y_w,Z_w,1]^T$$, the extrinsic matrix $$[R\mid t]$$ first rotates and translates it into the camera frame. The intrinsic matrix $$K$$ then converts the camera-frame coordinates into homogeneous pixel coordinates:

$$
P_c
=
\begin{bmatrix}
X \\
Y \\
Z
\end{bmatrix}
=
[R\mid t]P_w,
$$

$$
Z
\begin{bmatrix}
u \\
v \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
=
KP_c
=
K[R\mid t]P_w
=
PP_w,
\qquad
P=K[R\mid t].
$$

Thus, $$[R\mid t]$$ determines where the point is relative to the camera, while $$K$$ determines where its viewing ray appears in the pixel coordinate system. Together they form the $$3\times4$$ camera projection matrix $$P$$.

## Complete intrinsic matrix

The general intrinsic matrix is

$$
K=
\begin{bmatrix}
f_x & s & c_x \\
0 & f_y & c_y \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix},
$$

where:

- $$f_x,f_y$$ are focal lengths in pixels;

- $$c_x,c_y$$ are the principal point in pixels;

- $$s$$ is the skew coefficient.

For most modern cameras,

$$
s\approx0,
$$

so

$$
K=
\begin{bmatrix}
f_x & 0 & c_x \\
0 & f_y & c_y \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

The homogeneous projection is

$$
Z
\begin{bmatrix}
u \\
v \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
=
K
\begin{bmatrix}
X \\
Y \\
Z
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

Expanding,

$$
Zu=f_xX+c_xZ,
$$

$$
Zv=f_yY+c_yZ.
$$

Dividing by $$Z$$ gives

$$
\boxed{
u=f_x\frac{X}{Z}+c_x
},
\qquad
\boxed{
v=f_y\frac{Y}{Z}+c_y
}.
$$

## Calibrated mapping and coordinate conventions

Calibration defines a mapping for a chosen coordinate convention.

It does not mean:

> The software changes the real image into the virtual image.

It means:

The camera system provides a calibrated mathematical relationship:

$$
(X,Y,Z)\rightarrow(u,v)
$$

that already uses a chosen coordinate convention.

The calibration gives you:

$$
K=
\begin{bmatrix}
f_x & 0 & c_x \\
0 & f_y & c_y \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

and the projection model:

$$
u=f_x\frac{X}{Z}+c_x
$$

$$
v=f_y\frac{Y}{Z}+c_y
$$

This is the “calibrated mapping.”

### Camera parameter calibration

Suppose you have a chessboard.

You know its real 3D points:

$$
P_w
$$

You detect their image locations:

$$
(u,v)
$$

The calibration algorithm finds:

$$
K,R,t
$$

such that:

$$
Z
\begin{bmatrix}
u \\
v \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
=
K
\begin{bmatrix}
R \mid t
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
X_w \\
Y_w \\
Z_w \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The camera does not tell you:

> “The physical image plane is virtual.”

Instead, calibration says:

> “Given this pixel coordinate system, this $$K$$ makes the projection equations correct.”

## Physical and virtual image planes

This is the key idea:

A camera image is fundamentally a set of rays.

The 3D point:

$$
P_c=
\begin{bmatrix}
X \\
Y \\
Z
\end{bmatrix}
$$

creates a ray:

$$
\lambda
\begin{bmatrix}
X \\
Y \\
Z
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The physical sensor and virtual plane are just two different ways of selecting a point on this same ray.

---

Physical plane:

$$
Z=-f
$$

gives:

$$
x=-f\frac{X}{Z}
$$

Virtual plane:

$$
Z=f
$$

gives:

$$
x=f\frac{X}{Z}
$$

They differ only by a sign.

The ray itself did not change.

### OpenCV coordinate conventions

This coordinate convention has the following properties:

### Positive depth

Points in front of the camera have:

$$
Z>0
$$

instead of:

$$
Z<0
$$

### Horizontal pixel direction

A point on the right gives:

$$
u>c_x
$$

which matches image intuition.

### Positive focal lengths

The intrinsic matrix contains positive focal lengths:

$$
f_x>0
$$

instead of negative values.

This makes optimization and calibration much easier.

## Optical inversion and digital image conventions

Optical image formation and digital image representation are separate stages:

### Optical formation

The lens physically forms an inverted image.

### Digital image representation

The camera electronics output an image array.

The camera driver chooses:

- where pixel $$(0,0)$$ is,

- whether rows increase downward,

- whether columns increase rightward.

The final digital image coordinate system is what OpenCV sees.

So the manufacturer or camera firmware may indeed perform operations like:

- flipping,

- rotating,

- demosaicing,

- correcting sensor orientation.

But the important point is:

**OpenCV calibration is performed on the final digital image coordinates.**

The intrinsic matrix $$K$$ already describes the mapping between 3D rays and those pixels.


## Physical focal length $$f$$

The physical focal length is a length, commonly measured in millimetres:

$$
f_{\mathrm{physical}}
\quad [\mathrm{mm}].
$$

For example,

$$
f_{\mathrm{physical}}=4\ \mathrm{mm}.
$$

Pixel coordinates $$u$$ and $$v$$ are measured in pixels, so a focal length expressed in millimetres cannot be inserted directly into

$$
u=f_x\frac{X}{Z}+c_x.
$$

It must first be converted into pixel units.

## Focal lengths in pixels

The quantities $$f_x$$ and $$f_y$$ are focal lengths measured in horizontal and vertical pixels:

$$
f_x\quad[\mathrm{pixels}],
\qquad
f_y\quad[\mathrm{pixels}].
$$

Let the physical pixel pitches be

$$
d_x\quad[\mathrm{mm/pixel}],
\qquad
d_y\quad[\mathrm{mm/pixel}].
$$

Then

$$
\boxed{
f_x=\frac{f_{\mathrm{physical}}}{d_x}
},
\qquad
\boxed{
f_y=\frac{f_{\mathrm{physical}}}{d_y}
}.
$$

Equivalently, define pixel densities

$$
m_x=\frac{1}{d_x}
\quad[\mathrm{pixels/mm}],
\qquad
m_y=\frac{1}{d_y}
\quad[\mathrm{pixels/mm}].
$$

Then

$$
\boxed{
f_x=f_{\mathrm{physical}}m_x
},
\qquad
\boxed{
f_y=f_{\mathrm{physical}}m_y
}.
$$

Some texts use $$\alpha_x$$ and $$\alpha_y$$ instead of $$f_x$$ and $$f_y$$:

$$
\alpha_x=fm_x,
\qquad
\alpha_y=fm_y.
$$

These quantities have the same role as the OpenCV notation $$f_x,f_y$$.

### Numerical conversion example

Suppose

$$
f_{\mathrm{physical}}=4\ \mathrm{mm},
$$

with pixel pitches

$$
d_x=0.005\ \mathrm{mm/pixel},
\qquad
d_y=0.0048\ \mathrm{mm/pixel}.
$$

Then

$$
f_x=\frac{4}{0.005}=800\ \mathrm{pixels},
$$

and

$$
f_y=\frac{4}{0.0048}\approx833.33\ \mathrm{pixels}.
$$

The pixel projection is therefore

$$
u=800\frac{X}{Z}+c_x,
$$

$$
v=833.33\frac{Y}{Z}+c_y.
$$

Because $$X$$ and $$Z$$ use the same length unit,

$$
\frac{X}{Z}
$$

is dimensionless. Consequently, $$f_x(X/Z)$$ has units of pixels, matching $$u$$.

## Independent horizontal and vertical focal lengths

There are several practical reasons.

### Different pixel pitch

The horizontal and vertical physical pixel spacing can differ:

$$
d_x\neq d_y.
$$

Then

$$
f_x\neq f_y.
$$

### Image resizing

If an image is resized with horizontal and vertical scale factors $$r_x,r_y$$, the intrinsic parameters change as

$$
f_x'=r_xf_x,
\qquad
f_y'=r_yf_y,
$$

$$
c_x'=r_xc_x,
\qquad
c_y'=r_yc_y.
$$

### Calibration estimates the pixel geometry directly

In practice, $$f_x$$ and $$f_y$$ are normally estimated directly through calibration, rather than reconstructed from nominal lens focal length and sensor pitch. This captures small manufacturing and processing differences. For nominally square pixels,

$$
f_x\approx f_y,
$$

but they need not be forced to be exactly equal.
